# Waifu-Webhook
Discord webhook that gets anime pics on a regular basis
The images it gets are from [waifu.pics](https://waifu.pics/)
## How to develop

### Required packages

> webhook-discord
> node-fetch
> node-cron

To install all the packages:

> npm install webhook-discord node-fetch node-cron

this requires the `webhook-discord` node package, and that requires `snekfetch`, however running

> npm install webhook-discord

installs both.

To run:

> node index.js

This is probably temporary, will change it to be not jenk soon. 

## Add your server

I would hold off on this for now, its still in alpha stage, but, if you would like to add your server, leave an issue saying you would like to add your server, and the maintainers will add you to their list. **DO NOT LEAVE YOUR URL ENDPOINT IN THE ISSUE.** The maintainers will confirm via email and add it privatly.
